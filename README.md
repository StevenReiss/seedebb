SEEDEBB implements the user interface for using SEEDE from within code bubbles.  It should be cloned
or installed along with seede before any of them is compiled.  While it can be compiled separately
(run ant in the top level or in any of the source directories), it is usually build by running ant
at the top level of seede which includes seedebb in the seede plugin.
